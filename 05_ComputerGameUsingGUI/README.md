# Description
# This program creates a color guessing game using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). 
# The game involves the user selecting a color, and the computer attempts to guess the color. 
# If the computer guesses correctly, the user loses all points. 
# If the computer guesses incorrectly, the user earns points and can choose to continue playing or quit (You can risk gaining more points, or leave with the points you recieved).
# The game uses a countdown timer to close automatically after a specified time if the computer guesses correctly.
