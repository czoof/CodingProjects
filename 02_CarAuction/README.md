# Description:
# This program simulates an auction where three contestants (Joe, Mike, and Nick) bid on cars.
# Each car has a starting price, and the bidding continues for a set time until a winner is determined for each car.
# The highest bid wins the car, and the auction continues until all cars are sold.
# The contestants' bids are simulated randomly, and the auction timer runs for 5 seconds for each round of bidding.
