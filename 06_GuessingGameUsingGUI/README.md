# Description 
# This program creates a number guessing game using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). 
# The game allows the user to guess a number between 1 and 10, and the user has 3 tries to guess the correct number.
# If the user guesses correctly, a message is displayed, and the buttons are disabled. 
# If the user does not guess correctly within the allotted tries, the correct number is revealed, and the game automatically closes after a countdown.
